# WhileIterating_Game 
A modular, turn-based 2D RPG built in **Godot 4 with C#**.  
This project was developed over Summer 2025 as a way to practice **object-oriented design**, modular architecture, and scalable system design while creating a playable vertical slice of an RPG.

---

## Features
- **Turn-Based Combat System**  
  - Stamina & action mechanics (3 stamina, 3 actions per turn)  
  - Player and enemy skill sets (e.g., Slash, Thrust, Prayer, Block, Whirlwind)  
  - Combo and subclass mechanics (Berserker, Warder)  

- **Dungeon Flow**  
  - Node-based dungeon manager (enemy rooms, traps, rest areas, boss fights)  
  - Dynamic difficulty scaling with level progression  

- **Crafting & Inventory**  
  - Stackable inventory (up to 64 items per stack)  
  - Workbench crafting system (placeholder recipes implemented)  
  - Single chest system at home base for storage  

- **Day/Night Cycle**  
  - Five stages: Morning, Midmorning, Noon, Afternoon, Night  
  - Travel and sleep actions trigger time progression  

- **Home Base & Exploration**  
  - Player house with bed (sleep resets day to Morning)  
  - Overworld map linking to town, resource areas, and dungeon

## Technologies
- **Engine:** Godot 4  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub  
- **Design Focus:** OOP, Modular Architecture, Scalability

## Learning Outcomes
- Built a complete vertical slice of a turn-based RPG  
- Strengthened **Git/GitHub workflows** (daily commits, devlogs, version control)  
- Applied **object-oriented design** principles to modular systems  
- Designed scalable architecture for future features (quests, NPCs, lore integration)  

---

## Next Steps
- Refactor and modularize UI code  
- Add polished animations and combat visual effects  
- Expand farming & crafting systems to support long-term progression  
- Integrate lore systems (dream scenes, "The Turning" rebirth mechanic)
